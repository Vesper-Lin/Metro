Comments:
- In your test you are only checking one invalid case... You haven't checked valid
placements at all. You should be checking as many cases as you can think of. One case
is not a reasonable test. 
- You should add comments inside methods unless they are fully explained in the javadoc
or it is obvious from the code what it is doing. E.g. in CheckOverlap, put some comments saying
what your for loop is doing, etc. I've given you a half mark for "Code is well designed and documented" 
because you have added Java docs to most of your methods.
