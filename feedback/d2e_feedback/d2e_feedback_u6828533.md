Comments:
- You haven't submitted 20 lines of code, only 10. 
- You haven't tested all cases of your class. E.g. passing a negative number of players. 
- You should break your test up into smaller tests - e.g one that passes a too large number, 
one that passes a too small number, boundary cases, etc. 
- It's good that you've documented your method with a Java doc - I've given you a half mark for 
Code is well designed and documented.
