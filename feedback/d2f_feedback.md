JAR:

1 / 1 - All of the required files are correct and have been committed and pushed, passing the CI compliance test.
        The git log reveals healthy use of Git (some useful advice here).

Must have full marks above:

0.25 / 0.25 - All the code contains authorship details and is commented well, and is formatted properly. (Note: ‘authorship details’ is fairly open-ended. It may mean stating that the code was written by the group, or by one or two members, or that it was heavily adapted from some third party. Either way, it should be absolutely clear to the reader which person or persons were responsible for the code and the ideas behind it.).

0.25 / 0.25 - The game should execute correctly from the JAR file on the lab machines (although it may not yet be a complete implementation of all tasks).

Must have full marks above:

0.5 / 0.5 - You show a very good understanding of the limitations of your code and you are able to discuss possible ways of improving the quality, functionality, and/or performance.
