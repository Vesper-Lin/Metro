comments:
  - Best features of code is that to implement Task 6 from Metro.class, the decision conditions are seperated to different methods in Board.class.
    This makes author easier to design and test the code, and better to understand the task.
    It's good that IDE shows no warnings or errors for the code.

  - The code is mostly well-documented. Each method contains good Javadoc and comments, except for method isEmpty (Line 70).

  - The program decomposition of class and method structure is not adequate and not complete for Task 6.
    It only implements the two rules of the four rules for Task 6. Two of the four tests failed for Task 6.
    Thus, more methods should be added in order to to cover all the rules.

  - The code does not follow Java code conventions really well.
    There exists duplicate and improper naming.
    For instance, string name s1 (Line 21) from slice method is duplicated with placementSequence (Line 20) and its name makes no sense to end with a number.
    It's inappropriate to name the class as Board, since the class is only used to determine if a given placement sequence follows the rules of the game.
    Method name checkCS (Line 86) and string name bT (Line 98-100) are not good names.
    More magic numbers can be used. For example, integers 4 and 6 (Line 45) can be expressed by LENGTH_OF_PIECE (Line 8).

  - The style is consistent throughout. Author shows skillful use of ArrayList, HashSet and HashMap in all methods.

  - I suggest adding checkEdge and checkCorner methods for next, according to the rules in Task 6.
    Please remain substantial contribution and don't let Task 6 take too much time.
