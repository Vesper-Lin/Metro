comments:
  - Though not extensive, author tends to use the variable name as i fairly. This can be renamed to a much more relevant variable name.
    It would help in legibility of code.
  - Author has taken care to comment well. However, inline comments could be restricted to short, crisp sentences.
    Detailed description can be moved to before a block of code, if the author feels the necessity to explain in detail.
    Eg Line number 283.
  -The code was well structured.
  - Good usage of comments was visible.
  - Careful planning of coding visible, good strategies and usage of OOPS concepts visible.
  - Good usage of Collections and Generics to improve the performance.
  - The coding is of good standard and author displays good grasp of programming practices and data structures.
