comments:
  -Most methods have java doc and have comments, which is good.
  -The code follows Java code conventions,variables are properly named, which is also good to see.
  -The program decomposition is not appropriate. drawBoard method contains all the drawing for the board.
  -Could separate the big method into several small methods. e.g.,drawEdgeStation(),drawCentralStation() and drawTileCover().
  -Similarly, Lines 268-285 could be separated to two methods outside the makeControll() method. e.g.,drawPlayer() and drawNumberOfPlayerLabel() and call them inside the makeControll() method.
  -Use of magic numbers e.g., "hb.setLayoutX(130);" could make a global variable HB_COORDINATE_X=130
  -Not too sure why contains an inner class DrawPiece, could just create a new method called drawTiles() like what you have done for drawBoard() and call it inside the makePlacement().
  -Read yellow highlighted text, Intellij suggetes to make DrawPiece static.
  -Please contribute more. Nearly no new useful codes are updated in the past three weeks.
  -As discussed, you can start add more components in Viewer.class such as textbox for each player, tiles held in their hands and
  -tile drawn from deck. Tiles which are drawned from deck can be designed in a way that player drags it to
  -the board like the triangle example that Harriet demonstrated during last lab.
